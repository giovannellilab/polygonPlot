A **Polygon plot** (singular, Polygons plot, plural) is designed to visualize multivariate ranges as opposite to single data points. The concept of `polygons plot` was developed by [Donato Giovannelli](https://www.donatogiovannelli.com/) in late 2018 while working on our review [Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the Limits of Life in a Planetary Context](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00780), published in 2019 in Frontiers in Microbiology.

<summary>Story Details</summary>

While working on the review, he started collecting data regarding the range (minimum and maximum) for physico-chemical parameters of Earthâ€™s life such as pH, temperature, salinity and pressure. He wanted to visualize the ranges of these variables in a single plot, but I could not find a simple way to do it. After some research and a lot of doodling, the polygons plot was born!

## Installation

You can install the development version of polygonPlot from [GitHub](https://github.com/giovannellilab/polygonPlot) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("giovannellilab/polygonPlot")
```

## Example usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=TRUE}
library(polygonPlot)

df <- read.csv(system.file(file.path("extdata", "example.csv"), package="polygonPlot"))
df
```

```{r plot, eval=TRUE}
plot <- polygonplot(df, shape = 4, fillcolor = "#57cc99", linecolor = "#38a3a5",
                    labels_axis = c("Earth", "Mercury", "Venus", "Mars"))
plot
```

## Detailed Description

### Libraries

```{r library}
library(polygonPlot)
library(ggplot2)
```


### Input Parameters
#### Required

The `polygonplot` function requires two mandatory parameters: 

* __`df`__: the input `data.frame` that should be composed as follows:
  * The first column should contain the strings `axis_min`, `axis_max` and `data` 
in that row order.
  * All the columns, starting from the second, must be dedicated to the variables
of interest. In particular, the first two rows should contain the values for the 
`axis_min` and `axis_max` respectively. 
    * If left empty, the axis_min/max will be automatically calculated based on data given and 
extension will be decided based on the Axes range extension (`extra` parameter).
  * Starting from the third row, each variable column must contain all the data values.
  * As default, column names will be used as labels of the axis 
(starting from the second one). Change them in order to change the labels, 
but don't leave them empty.


* __`shape`__: the `integer` value indicating the shape of the polygon. 
Available numbers:
  * `3` for _Triangle_
  * `4` for _Square_
  * `5` for _Pentagon_
  * `6` for _Hexagon_


Examples of the input `data.frame`
```{r load-data}
df <- read.csv(system.file(file.path("extdata", "example.csv"), package="polygonPlot"))
df
```

a minimal version
```{r load-data-minimal}
df_min <- read.csv(system.file(file.path("extdata", "minimal_example.csv"), 
                               package="polygonPlot"))
df_min
```

#### Optional

* __`extra`__:  axis range extension
* __`fillcolor`__: fill color of the polygon
* __`alpha`__: alpha value of the fill color
* __`linecolor`__: line color of the polygon border
* __`linetype`__: line type of the polygon border
* __`lwd`__: line width of the polygon border
* __`labels_axis`__: vector with the desired labels of the axis
* __`title`__: title of the plot
* __`fix_aspect_ratio`__: boolean flag to fix the aspect ratio of the plot as 
`1`. It is strongly recommended to leave it as default value `TRUE`. 
  * __NOTE__: If you are going to change the theme of the returned ggplot object, remember to put in 
the `theme` function the following code `aspect.ratio = 1` in order to 
keep the text and the relative ticks aligned on the axis. 

See the section `About the aspect.ratio` for a practical example.

### Return

* __`ggplot2`__ object.


### Polygons
#### Shape: 3 - Triangle

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7 }
plot_triangle <- polygonplot(df, shape = 3, fillcolor = "#e56b6f", linecolor = "#b56576",
                             labels_axis = c("earth", "moon", "sun"))
plot_triangle
```


#### Shape: 4 - Square

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7 }
plot_square <- polygonplot(df, shape = 4, fillcolor = "#57cc99", linecolor = "#38a3a5")
plot_square
```

#### Shape: 5 - Pentagon

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
plot_pentagon <- polygonplot(df, shape = 5, fillcolor = "#c89f9c", linecolor = "#b36a5e")
plot_pentagon
```

#### Shape: 6 - Hexagon

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
plot_hexagon <- polygonplot(df, shape = 6, fillcolor = "#0077b6", linecolor = "#023e8a")
plot_hexagon
```


### About the `aspect.ratio`
As described above, the `polygonplot` function return a `ggplot2` object. 
If you are going to change the theme of the returned ggplot object, it is
strongly recommended to specify in the `theme` function the `aspect.ratio = 1` in 
order to keep the text and the relative ticks aligned on the axis.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
plot_pentagon <- polygonplot(df, shape = 5, fillcolor = "#c89f9c", linecolor = "#b36a5e")
plot_pentagon + theme_bw() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
