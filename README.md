The R package **polygonPlot** is designed to
visualize multivariate ranges as opposite to single data points. The
concept of `polygons plot` was design by [Donato
Giovannelli](https://www.donatogiovannelli.com/) in late 2018 while
working on our review [Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the
Limits of Life in a Planetary
Context](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00780), published in 2019 in
Frontiers in Microbiology.
